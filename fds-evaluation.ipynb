Mammograms can detect breast cancer early, possibly before it has spread.

We're looking at breast cancer, which is the second most common cancer in women. It's important to catch it early, and mammograms can help with that. Now, when it comes to treating breast cancer, there are a few main options. \n\nFirst off, there's surgery. This is often the first step, and it can be either a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. Lumpectomy is where they just take out the tumor, and mastectomy is when they remove the whole breast. \n\nThen there's radiation therapy. This is usually done after surgery to make sure no cancer cells are left behind. It's like a backup plan to ensure everything is taken care of. \n\nAnd let's not forget about chemotherapy. This is a systemic treatment, meaning it targets cancer cells throughout the body. It's often used after surgery to make sure no cancer cells are lurking around. \n\nOh, and there's also hormone therapy. This is for people whose cancer is fueled by hormones, like estrogen. It's a way to stop the cancer from growing by\n\n\n============================================================\n--- System B: AFTER Preprocessing (Clean Data) ---\nQuestion: What are the treatment options for breast cancer?\n--------------------------------------------------\n[DEBUG] Top Retrieved Context (First 500 chars):\nTopic: Breast.

Category: Treatment & Ther...\n--------------------\n\nResponse:\nalright, let's think about this. we're looking at breast cancer, which is the second most common cancer in women after skin cancer. so, it's pretty common, and it's important to catch it early. mammograms are key here because they can detect breast cancer before it spreads. that's crucial.\n\nnow, when it comes to treatment, i remember that there are a few main options. there's surgery, like lumpectomy or mastectomy, which is about removing the tumor. then there's radiation therapy, which helps kill off any remaining cancer cells. and let's not forget chemotherapy, which is a systemic treatment that targets cancer cells throughout the body.\n\noh, and there's also hormone therapy, which is used when the cancer is hormone-sensitive. it's like a targeted approach to stop the cancer from growing.\n\nso, putting it all together, the treatment options for breast cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. that's what i've got from the context, and it seems to match up with what i know about breast cancer treatment.\n\nthe treatment options\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\nimport evaluate\n\n# --- 1.
